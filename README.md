# ✈️ SkyPlane3D

**SkyPlane3D** is a 3D video game developed as a final project for the *Computer Graphics* course. In this game, the player controls an airplane flying through the sky while dodging obstacles in a dynamic environment. The project integrates concepts such as real-time rendering, camera systems, texturing, collision detection, and graphical user interface design using modern tools like OpenGL, GLFW, GLM, and ImGui.

## 🚀 Main Features

- Real-time 3D rendering with OpenGL.
- Airplane model imported from Sketchfab in `.glTF` format.
- Advanced texturing and immersive skybox.
- Fully functional GUI using **ImGui**:
  - Main menu
  - Pause menu
  - Game Over screen
- Language support (Spanish / English).
- Score system based on survival time.

## 🧠 Implemented Concepts

- 3D transformations (translation, rotation, scaling)
- Third-person camera system
- Resource management (loading models, textures, shaders)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **OpenGL** – Graphics rendering engine
- **GLFW** – Window creation and input handling
- **GLM** – Math library for 3D graphics
- **stb_image** – Texture loading
- **ImGui** – Graphical User Interface
- **JSON + Assimp** – Model import (`.glTF`)
- **SDL2** – Sound effects and music playback
- **C++** – Main programming language
